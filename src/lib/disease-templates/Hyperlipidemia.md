## Monitoring Priorities
- Monitor for any muscle-related side effects from statin therapy (myalgias, weakness), and clarify if they are new, persistent, or different from usual aches.
- Encourage adherence to a heart-healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean, DASH) and regular physical activity.
- Track follow-up lab appointments for lipid panel monitoring.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to statin therapy as the cornerstone of treatment.
- If prescribed, ensure adherence to other lipid-lowering therapies like ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.
- Counsel on the importance of statins for long-term cardiovascular risk reduction, not just cholesterol numbers.
- Address and contextualize patient concerns about statin side effects, reinforcing the importance of discussing with their physician before stopping medication.

## Escalation Triggers
- Development of severe, debilitating muscle pain or weakness (concern for rhabdomyolysis), especially if accompanied by dark urine.
- New-onset confusion or memory issues, which have been rarely reported with statins and warrant physician review.
- Patient stopping high-intensity statin therapy due to side effects without consulting their provider, especially in high-risk patients (e.g., post-MI, known CAD).
