# Post-Cardiac Surgery Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Daily monitoring of sternal incision for signs of infection: redness, swelling, drainage, or increased pain.
- Track for fever (e.g., temperature >100.4°F or 38°C).
- Monitor for symptoms of pericarditis or effusion: sharp chest pain that improves when leaning forward, shortness of breath.
- Assess for mood changes, as post-operative depression is common.
- Daily weight to monitor for fluid retention.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to all new cardiac medications, including antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel), beta-blockers, and statins.
- Ensure adequate pain management to allow for deep breathing and participation in cardiac rehab.
- For post-valve replacement, strict adherence to anticoagulation as indicated.
- Reinforce medication plan for managing comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).

## Escalation Triggers
- Any signs of sternal wound infection or non-healing.
- Fever, especially if accompanied by chills or other signs of systemic infection.
- New or worsening atrial fibrillation (common post-op) or other arrhythmias.
- Symptoms of heart failure: significant weight gain, worsening shortness of breath, or lower extremity edema.
- Worsening chest pain, especially if different from incisional pain.
