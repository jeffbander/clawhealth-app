# Obesity / Weight Management Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Weekly weight tracking, same day and time for consistency.
- Monitor for side effects of weight management medications (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea with GLP-1 agonists).
- Assess for improvements in related comorbidities (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose).
- Encourage tracking of dietary intake and physical activity.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to prescribed weight management medications, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide).
- Review proper injection technique for injectable medications.
- Counsel on managing common gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., eating smaller meals, avoiding high-fat foods).
- Reinforce that these medications are adjuncts to, not replacements for, lifestyle modification.

## Escalation Triggers
- Severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms that limit oral intake.
- Symptoms of pancreatitis (severe, persistent abdominal pain radiating to the back) or gallbladder disease (right upper quadrant pain).
- Any signs of a serious allergic reaction (e.g., swelling of face/throat, difficulty breathing).
- Lack of weight loss or continued weight gain after 3 months of therapy, prompting re-evaluation by the physician.
