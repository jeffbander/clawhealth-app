# COPD / Asthma Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Track frequency of rescue inhaler (e.g., albuterol) use and document triggers.
- Monitor for changes in cough, sputum color/volume, or increased shortness of breath.
- Assess for wheezing or chest tightness, especially with exertion.
- For patients with oximeters, check oxygen saturation (SpO2) at rest and with activity if instructed.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to controller/maintenance inhalers (e.g., LAMA, LABA, ICS) and review proper technique.
- Reinforce the distinction between rescue and controller medications.
- Counsel on potential for beta-agonists (albuterol) to transiently increase heart rate, especially in patients with known cardiac conditions like AFib.
- Ensure patient has an action plan for worsening symptoms, as defined by their physician.

## Escalation Triggers
- Increased need for rescue inhaler for 2-3 consecutive days.
- New or worsening shortness of breath at rest, or breathlessness that interferes with sleep or speaking in full sentences.
- Change in sputum to a purulent color (yellow, green) or a significant increase in volume.
- Development of fever, chills, or other signs of respiratory infection.
- Worsening symptoms despite use of rescue inhaler and adherence to action plan.
