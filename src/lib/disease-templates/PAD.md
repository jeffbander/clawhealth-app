# Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Monitor for classic PAD symptoms: claudication (leg pain, cramping, or weakness with walking that resolves with rest).
- Assess for signs of advanced PAD: rest pain (pain in the feet or toes at rest), non-healing wounds or ulcers on the legs or feet.
- Track walking distance and duration to establish a baseline and monitor for changes.
- Encourage daily foot inspection for any new sores, color changes (paleness, blueness), or temperature differences.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) to reduce cardiovascular events.
- Verify adherence to statin therapy for lipid management and plaque stabilization.
- Ensure cilostazol is taken as prescribed for symptomatic claudication, if applicable.
- Reinforce strict blood pressure and glucose control, as hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors.

## Escalation Triggers
- New or worsening pain at rest, which is a sign of critical limb ischemia.
- Development of a new ulcer, wound, or area of infection on the foot or lower leg.
- Sudden onset of a cold, painful, or pulseless limb, which is an acute limb ischemia emergency.
- Any rapidly progressing symptoms or a sudden decrease in walking ability.
