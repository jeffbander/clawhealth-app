# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Blood pressure monitoring at least 5 days/week, targeting physician-specified goal (e.g., <130/80 mmHg).
- Monitor for new or worsening edema (swelling) in legs, ankles, or around the eyes.
- Track urinary symptoms: decreased output, foamy appearance, or nocturia.
- Watch for symptoms of uremia: fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, or metallic taste.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to prescribed ACE inhibitor or ARB for blood pressure control and proteinuria reduction.
- Verify statin use if indicated for cardiovascular risk.
- For diabetic patients, ensure SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist is used if prescribed for renal protection.
- Reinforce avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, especially NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), unless cleared by nephrology.

## Escalation Triggers
- Blood pressure consistently above goal (e.g., >140/90 mmHg) for 3 consecutive days.
- New or sudden onset of significant edema.
- Symptoms concerning for hyperkalemia: muscle weakness, palpitations, or paralysis.
- Severe uremic symptoms, particularly persistent vomiting or confusion.
