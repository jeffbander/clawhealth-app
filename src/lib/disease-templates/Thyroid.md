# Hypothyroidism / Hyperthyroidism Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- **Hypothyroidism:** Monitor for fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and bradycardia.
- **Hyperthyroidism:** Monitor for palpitations, anxiety, weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor, and tachycardia.
- Track heart rate and blood pressure regularly, noting any significant changes from baseline.
- Assess for mood changes, as both conditions can significantly impact mental health (depression with hypothyroidism, anxiety/agitation with hyperthyroidism).

## Medication Priorities
- **Hypothyroidism:** Confirm adherence to levothyroxine and timing (e.g., 30-60 mins before breakfast on an empty stomach). Counsel on avoiding co-administration with calcium, iron, or antacids.
- **Hyperthyroidism:** Ensure adherence to anti-thyroid medications (methimazole, PTU) or beta-blockers prescribed for symptom control.
- Reinforce that thyroid hormone levels can affect the metabolism of other cardiac drugs (e.g., warfarin, digoxin), requiring potential dose adjustments by the physician.

## Escalation Triggers
- **Hypothyroidism:** Severe bradycardia (e.g., HR < 50 bpm), altered mental status, or signs of myxedema crisis (severe lethargy, hypothermia).
- **Hyperthyroidism:** Heart rate consistently >100 bpm at rest, new atrial fibrillation, chest pain, or signs of thyroid storm (high fever, agitation, delirium).
- Any new neurological symptoms, such as significant tremor, confusion, or severe anxiety/panic.
- For patients with known heart failure, any worsening of HF symptoms as thyroid dysfunction can be a precipitant.
