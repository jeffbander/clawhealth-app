# Sleep Apnea Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Monitor for symptoms of uncontrolled sleep apnea: excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, loud snoring, or witnessed apneas.
- Track adherence to PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) therapy, including hours of use per night and mask leak.
- Assess for improvements in blood pressure or other related conditions.
- Screen for ongoing daytime fatigue despite PAP use.

## Medication Priorities
- Sleep apnea is primarily a non-pharmacologic condition. The focus is on device adherence.
- Reinforce that sedative medications or alcohol before bed can worsen sleep apnea.
- Encourage weight management, as obesity is a major contributor to sleep apnea.

## Escalation Triggers
- Persistent or worsening daytime sleepiness despite good PAP adherence, which may indicate a need for pressure adjustments or further evaluation.
- New or worsening cardiovascular symptoms, such as uncontrolled hypertension, new arrhythmias (especially AFib), or worsening heart failure.
- Patient stopping PAP therapy due to side effects (e.g., mask discomfort, nasal congestion) without consulting their provider.
- Any safety-related events, such as falling asleep while driving.
