# Anxiety / Depression Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Track mood, anxiety levels, and sleep patterns using a simple daily scale (e.g., 1-10).
- Monitor for physical symptoms that can overlap with cardiac disease: chest tightness, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
- Assess for changes in energy, interest in activities (anhedonia), and social engagement.
- Screen for thoughts of self-harm or hopelessness.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to prescribed antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs) or anxiolytics.
- Counsel on the time course for medication efficacy (often 4-6 weeks for antidepressants).
- Be aware of potential cardiac side effects of certain psychotropic medications (e.g., QTc prolongation with some antidepressants, tachycardia with bupropion).
- Reinforce that medication is most effective when combined with therapy and lifestyle changes.

## Escalation Triggers
- Any expressed thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or harming others — requires immediate escalation.
- Worsening depression or anxiety despite adherence to treatment plan for several weeks.
- Development of new, severe physical symptoms (e.g., panic attacks) that are difficult to distinguish from a cardiac event.
- Patient-reported side effects that are intolerable or concerning (e.g., significant agitation, insomnia, or cardiac-specific symptoms).
