# Chronic Pain Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Track pain levels, location, and impact on daily function and sleep.
- Monitor use of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescribed pain medications.
- Specifically ask about use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) as they are often used OTC.
- Assess for mood changes, as chronic pain and depression are frequently comorbid.

## Medication Priorities
- Reinforce strict avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with heart failure, CKD, or on anticoagulants, due to risks of sodium retention, renal dysfunction, and bleeding.
- Encourage use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) as a first-line agent for mild-to-moderate pain if not contraindicated.
- Confirm adherence to prescribed non-NSAID pain relievers (e.g., tramadol, gabapentinoids) if applicable.
- Promote non-pharmacologic strategies: physical therapy, heat/cold therapy, mindfulness, etc.

## Escalation Triggers
- Patient report of using NSAIDs despite being advised against it, especially if new cardiac or renal symptoms develop.
- Worsening pain that is not controlled with the current regimen, leading to decreased quality of life or function.
- Development of side effects from pain medications (e.g., constipation from opioids, sedation from gabapentinoids).
- Any new cardiac symptoms (e.g., edema, shortness of breath) in a patient who admits to recent NSAID use.
