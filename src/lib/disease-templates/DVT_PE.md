# DVT / Pulmonary Embolism Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Monitor for signs of new or worsening DVT: unilateral leg swelling, pain, warmth, or redness.
- Monitor for signs of PE: sudden onset of shortness of breath, sharp chest pain (especially with inspiration), or coughing up blood (hemoptysis).
- Assess for signs of bleeding, the main complication of anticoagulation (e.g., unusual bruising, nosebleeds, blood in urine or stool).
- Track adherence to follow-up appointments for INR monitoring if on warfarin.

## Medication Priorities
- Confirm adherence to prescribed anticoagulant (e.g., DOACs like apixaban, rivaroxaban; or warfarin).
- For warfarin, reinforce dietary consistency with vitamin K-containing foods.
- For all anticoagulants, counsel on avoiding other medications that increase bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin) unless approved by their physician.
- Ensure patient has a clear plan for managing missed doses.

## Escalation Triggers
- Symptoms of a new or recurrent PE (sudden, severe shortness of breath or chest pain) — requires immediate emergency evaluation.
- Signs of major bleeding: severe headache, confusion (intracranial hemorrhage); black, tarry stools or vomiting blood (GI bleed); or trauma-related bleeding that is difficult to control.
- New unilateral leg swelling or pain suggesting a new or worsening DVT.
- For warfarin patients, a critically high INR value as reported by their clinic.
