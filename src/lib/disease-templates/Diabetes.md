## Monitoring Priorities
- Track glucose values with timing (fasting/post-prandial/bedtime).
- Capture hypoglycemia symptoms and correction response.
- Monitor weight and blood pressure where cardiometabolic risk is high.

## Medication Priorities
- Reinforce adherence to glucose-lowering regimen and administration timing.
- Document side effects affecting adherence (GI symptoms, dizziness, etc.).

## Escalation Triggers
- Recurrent hypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia symptoms.
- Persistent fasting glucose above agreed goal despite adherence.
- New foot wounds, vision changes, or signs of infection.
