# Valvular Heart Disease Template

## Monitoring Priorities
- Monitor for symptoms of worsening valve disease: increasing shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion or when lying flat (orthopnea).
- Track for new or worsening chest pain, pressure, or tightness.
- Assess for dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting spells (syncope), particularly with activity.
- Watch for new or worsening edema in the ankles, feet, or abdomen.

## Medication Priorities
- **Aortic Stenosis:** Primarily symptomatic management; medications have limited role. Focus on managing co-morbidities like hypertension carefully.
- **Mitral Regurgitation/Aortic Regurgitation:** Adherence to medications that reduce afterload (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs) if prescribed to lessen regurgitant volume.
- Adherence to diuretics for symptom control in decompensated states.
- For patients post-valve replacement, ensure strict adherence to anticoagulation if a mechanical valve was placed.

## Escalation Triggers
- Any new or worsening symptoms, particularly rapid progression of shortness of breath or new syncope.
- Development of symptoms suggestive of heart failure (e.g., significant edema, orthopnea).
- For patients on anticoagulation, signs of bleeding or a subtherapeutic/supratherapeutic INR.
- Any new cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, which is common in valvular disease.
