# ClawHealth: AI-Powered Patient Health Coordinators

**A Comprehensive Business Plan for Investor Review**

*February 20, 2026*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ClawHealth is pioneering a new model of chronic disease management by providing each patient with a dedicated, AI-powered health coordinator. Starting with cardiology, our platform addresses the critical gaps in care for patients with conditions like Heart Failure (HF), Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and Hypertension (HTN). Our solution is built on a patient-owned AI agent architecture, supervised by physicians, and delivered through accessible SMS and voice channels. This approach enhances patient engagement, improves adherence to care plans, and enables timely clinical escalations, ultimately reducing hospital readmissions and improving patient outcomes.

The company is founded by Dr. Jeffrey Bander, Chief of Cardiology at Mount Sinai West, and is supported by an AI-first development team. ClawHealth's business model is grounded in the existing and growing Chronic Care Management (CCM) reimbursement framework, ensuring sustainable revenue from day one. We project reaching a $5.2 million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) run rate by the end of Year 3, driven by a blended model of CCM billing, a SaaS subscription for cardiology practices, and a premium patient subscription.

We are seeking a **$2 million seed investment** to scale our engineering team, expand our go-to-market efforts beyond our initial launch at Mount Sinai, and secure our position as the leader in AI-driven chronic care coordination. The market for CCM is substantial, with a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of $1.2 billion in cardiology alone and only 10% of eligible Medicare patients currently enrolled. ClawHealth is uniquely positioned to capture this underserved market through its physician-led, patient-centric, and technologically advanced solution.

## 2. The Problem: A Widening Gap in Chronic Care

The management of chronic disease in the United States is facing a multifaceted crisis. Over 133 million Americans live with at least one chronic condition, accounting for 90% of the nation's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare spending. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and a primary driver of these costs. Despite the scale of the problem, the current system is failing patients, providers, and payers.

*   **The Patient Engagement Gap:** Patients with chronic conditions require continuous monitoring, education, and support between office visits. The current system, reliant on sporadic follow-ups and manual outreach, leaves patients feeling isolated and unequipped to manage their health effectively. This leads to poor medication adherence, missed warning signs, and preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations. For heart failure patients, the 30-day readmission rate remains stubbornly high at around 20%, representing a significant and costly failure of post-discharge care.

*   **Physician Burnout:** Clinicians are overwhelmed. The administrative burden of managing large patient panels with complex needs is a leading cause of burnout, with nearly 48% of physicians reporting symptoms [8]. The time-consuming nature of care coordination, documentation, and patient communication detracts from high-value clinical work and contributes to a projected decline in the physician workforce, especially in critical specialties and rural areas.

*   **CCM Underutilization:** In response to this challenge, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Chronic Care Management (CCM) program, offering monthly reimbursement for non-face-to-face care coordination. However, the operational complexity of tracking time, documenting interactions, and meeting billing requirements has led to massive underutilization. It is estimated that only 10% of the 22.5 million eligible Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a CCM program, representing a significant missed opportunity for both revenue and improved patient care [3].

## 3. The Solution: ClawHealth's Patient-Owned AI Coordinator

ClawHealth directly addresses these challenges with a novel, AI-first solution: a dedicated, autonomous health coordinator for every patient. Our platform is not a generic chatbot; it is a persistent, learning AI agent that is owned by the patient and supervised by their physician.

Our solution is built on three core principles:

1.  **Patient-Centric Engagement:** We meet patients where they are, primarily via SMS and voice. The AI agent proactively engages patients with personalized medication reminders, symptom check-ins, and educational content based on their specific condition and care plan. This continuous, low-friction interaction fosters trust and encourages adherence.

2.  **Physician-Supervised Autonomy:** Dr. Jeffrey Bander and the clinical team oversee all AI interactions. A sophisticated, three-layer architecture ensures patient safety and clinical relevance. The system is designed to handle routine interactions autonomously while intelligently escalating concerning symptoms or trends to the clinical team for intervention. This frees up physicians to focus on patients who need them most.

3.  **Seamless Reimbursement Integration:** The platform is designed from the ground up to automate the requirements of the CCM billing model. All patient interactions, time spent, and care plan activities are meticulously logged, generating compliant documentation to support CPT codes 99490, 99491, and 99439. This turns a complex administrative task into a streamlined, reliable revenue source for practices.

By providing each patient with their own AI health agent, ClawHealth creates a scalable, personalized, and continuous layer of support that has been previously impossible to deliver.

## 4. Market Analysis

The market opportunity for ClawHealth is substantial and growing. We are positioned at the intersection of several large, high-growth markets: chronic care management, digital health, and artificial intelligence.

*   **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** The overall chronic disease management market in the US is valued in the hundreds of billions. The direct CCM platform market is projected to grow from $5.7 billion in 2024 to over $12.1 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 13.2% [1].

*   **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** Focusing on cardiology, the market for remote patient monitoring (RPM) and CCM services is approximately **$1.2 billion**. This is derived from the millions of patients with conditions like HF, AFib, CAD, and HTN who are eligible for these programs.

*   **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** Our initial target is the ~10,000 eligible Medicare patients within the Mount Sinai Health System and affiliated practices. Capturing just 5% of this initial market (500 patients) in our first year represents an annual revenue opportunity of over $450,000 from CCM billing alone. As we expand to other cardiology practices, we project capturing a fraction of the 90% of the market that is currently unenrolled in CCM, representing a multi-billion dollar greenfield opportunity.

Key market drivers include the aging US population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases (6.7 million Americans with heart failure alone [5]), the value-based care transition, and the growing acceptance of telehealth and AI in healthcare [13].

## 5. Business Model & Revenue Streams

ClawHealth's revenue model is designed for sustainability and scalability, with three distinct, synergistic streams.

1.  **CCM Billing (Core Revenue):** Our primary revenue driver is a share of the CCM reimbursements generated for our partner practices. We will operate on a revenue-share or per-patient-per-month (PPPM) fee structure. Based on 2026 reimbursement rates, we project a blended average revenue of **$78.30 per patient per month** [4]. This model aligns our incentives with our customers and provides a clear ROI from day one.

2.  **SaaS Subscription:** For larger practices and health systems, we will offer a tiered SaaS subscription, ranging from **$500 to $2,000 per month**. This subscription provides access to the platform, advanced analytics dashboards for population health management, and integration with the practice's Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.

3.  **Patient Premium Subscription:** A direct-to-patient subscription will be offered for **$9.99 per month**, providing enhanced features such as advanced health tracking, personalized insights, and integrations with consumer wellness devices. We project a conservative 5% adoption rate among our patient base.

This multi-pronged approach diversifies our revenue, captures value from all stakeholders (practices and patients), and builds a defensible moat around our core CCM offering.

## 6. Competitive Analysis

The healthcare AI landscape is dynamic, but ClawHealth possesses key differentiators that provide a significant competitive edge. Our primary competitors include horizontal AI agent providers and existing care management platforms.

## 7. Technology & Architecture

ClawHealth is built on a modern, secure, and scalable technology stack designed for the rigorous demands of healthcare.

*   **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, Prisma, Neon PostgreSQL, Clerk Auth, Twilio SMS/Voice, Claude API, Vercel.
*   **Security & HIPAA Compliance:** All patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256-GCM. Our architecture is designed to be fully HIPAA compliant, with strict access controls and audit logs. Each patient's AI agent state is stored in an encrypted, isolated database to ensure privacy.

Our system employs a unique three-layer architecture:

*   **Layer 1: The Physician Agent (Albert):** This master agent monitors the entire patient population, identifying trends and flagging patients who show signs of clinical deterioration. It also automates the generation of CCM billing documentation and escalates critical alerts directly to Dr. Bander and the care team.

*   **Layer 2: The Patient Agent Service:** This is the core of our platform, managing the individual AI agents for each patient. It combines stateless compute for processing interactions with a stateful, encrypted memory layer that allows each agent to learn and personalize its support over time. Condition-specific system prompts (e.g., for HF vs. HTN) ensure clinically relevant dialogue.

*   **Layer 3: The Communication Layer:** Built on Twilio, this layer manages all inbound and outbound communication via SMS and voice. It is designed for high reliability and can initiate proactive outreach based on triggers from the Patient Agent Service.

This architecture provides a robust, multi-layered defense for patient safety and allows for scalable, autonomous operation under clinical supervision.
