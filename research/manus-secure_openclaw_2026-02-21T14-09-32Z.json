  "body": "# Key Findings on Securing OpenClaw for ClawHealth\n\n**To:** Albert\n**From:** Manus AI\n**Date:** February 21, 2026\n\nAlbert,\n\nHere is a summary of the research findings on securing OpenClaw for the ClawHealth project. The full, detailed research document is also attached.\n\n### 1. On the CrowdStrike Claim\n\nYou were correct that CrowdStrike did not file a CVE against OpenClaw. My previous statement was a misinterpretation. CrowdStrike published a blog post analyzing the *deployment risks* of OpenClaw in enterprise environments, but they were not the source of any specific CVEs.\n\nHowever, the core issue of vulnerabilities is very real. My research confirmed **41 published CVEs** for OpenClaw as of February 2026, including critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. So, while the source was mistaken, the concern about security is valid.\n\n### 2. OpenClaw's Security Gaps for HIPAA\n\nOut-of-the-box, OpenClaw is not HIPAA compliant. The primary gaps are:\n\n*   **No Encryption at Rest:** Credentials, session history, and workspace files are all stored in plaintext. This is the most significant and immediate blocker for HIPAA.\n*   **No Audit Logging:** There is no built-in, immutable audit trail to log access to PHI, a core HIPAA requirement.\n*   **Weak Isolation:** The default workspace provides some isolation but is not a hard sandbox. An agent could potentially access data outside its designated workspace.\n\n### 3. Options for a HIPAA-Compliant Deployment\n\nThere are three main paths forward:\n\n*   **Harden Stock OpenClaw:** This would be a major engineering project. We would need to build custom solutions for encrypting session stores and credentials, implement a comprehensive audit logging system, and enforce strict sandboxing. This offers the most control but has the highest upfront cost and longest timeline (estimated 6-12 months).\n\n*   **Use a Fork (HIPAAclaw):** A fork called HIPAAclaw is being developed specifically for HIPAA compliance. It promises to have all the necessary features like encryption and audit logging built-in. However, it is not yet publicly available and is initially focused on dental practices. We are on the waitlist for their private beta.\n\n*   **Use a Competing Framework:** Platforms like **actAVA** and **Kamiwaza** are designed for healthcare and offer HIPAA-compliant AI agent orchestration out of the box. They are enterprise-grade solutions and would likely involve significant licensing costs, but would dramatically shorten the time to a compliant deployment.\n\n### 4. Scalability\n\nThe native OpenClaw architecture, with a single Gateway process, will not scale to 1,000+ patient-agents. The single Node.js process will become a bottleneck. To achieve this scale, we would need a distributed architecture with multiple Gateway instances running in containers (e.g., on Kubernetes), a load balancer, and a centralized, database-backed session store instead of the default filesystem-based one.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nGiven the significant engineering effort required to harden stock OpenClaw, I recommend we seriously evaluate **actAVA** as a potential alternative while we wait for more information on **HIPAAclaw**. Building our own security layer is feasible but would be a substantial project in itself, diverting resources from the core mission of ClawHealth.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed.\n\nBest,\n\nManus AI Manus\n",
