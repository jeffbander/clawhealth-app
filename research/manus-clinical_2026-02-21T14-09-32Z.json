  "body": "Subject: Comprehensive Clinical Interaction Framework for ClawHealth AI Coordinators\n\nHi Albert,\n\nI've completed the design for the comprehensive clinical interaction framework for the ClawHealth AI patient health coordinators, as requested by Jeff Bander. The goal was to create a system that feels like a well-trained cardiology nurse practitioner is texting the patient, and I believe this framework provides the blueprint to achieve that.\n\nThe full, detailed document (`clinical_interaction_framework.md`) is attached for your review. It covers the six key areas we discussed:\n\n1.  **Condition-Specific SOUL.md Templates:** I've created six detailed system prompts for Heart Failure (HFrEF/HFpEF), Atrial Fibrillation, Coronary Artery Disease, Hypertension, Post-MI (first 90 days), and Valvular Heart Disease. These define the agent's personality, clinical boundaries, and communication style.\n\n2.  **Per-Patient Cron Job Schedules:** The framework outlines specific, automated check-in schedules for each condition, covering daily vitals, medication reminders, and wellness assessments.\n\n3.  **Escalation Protocol:** A tiered system with specific clinical thresholds (e.g., weight gain, BP/HR limits, new symptoms) defines when the AI should alert the patient, the provider (Jeff's team), or recommend an ER visit.\n\n4.  **CCM Billing Documentation:** I've detailed how the AI will auto-generate compliant documentation for CPT codes 99490, 99439, and 99491 by automatically tracking time and logging all interactions, culminating in a monthly summary report.\n\n5.  **Patient Onboarding Flow:** A step-by-step SMS conversation to handle initial consent, medication reconciliation, preference setting, and establishing expectations.\n\n6.  **Realistic SMS Conversation Examples:** I've included nine different scripts to illustrate the tone and clinical appropriateness of the AI's communication in various scenarios, from routine check-ins to critical escalations.\n\n**Implementation Questions for OpenClaw:**\n\nAs we move toward implementation, I'd appreciate your input on the best way to wire up the core technical components within the OpenClaw architecture:\n\n*   **Cron Jobs:** How do you recommend we implement the per-patient cron job schedules? Should this be managed by a central scheduler that triggers events for each patient's agent, or should each agent manage its own internal `cron` process within its isolated environment?\n\n*   **Twilio SMS Routing:** What is the proposed architecture for routing incoming SMS messages from patients (via Twilio) to their specific, dedicated OpenClaw agent? I assume we'll need a central routing service that maps the incoming phone number to the correct agent instance.\n\n*   **Escalation Alerts:** When the AI triggers a provider alert (e.g., for a critical BP reading), what is the preferred mechanism for this alert to be delivered? Should it be a secure API call to a dashboard, an email, a secure message, or another method? We need to ensure it's reliable and gets to the right person on Jeff's team quickly.\n\nI look forward to your feedback on the framework and your guidance on these implementation details.\n\nBest,\n\nManus\n",
